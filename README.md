# Wirth and Duchene 2021 - Supplementary Information 

Here you'll find the supplementary information for our protocol "Demystifying Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Pathogen Bayesian Phylodynamics - A Guide for BEAST Best Practices."

The protocol uses the `ebola.fasta` file in the `02_cleaned_alignment` folder. The script (`clean_alignments.sh`) to produce this file from the raw data is in the `scripts` folder. The `scripts` also contains scripts for producing ML tress, plotting output, and running BEAST on a HPC. 

The folder `ebola_1634265604` contains the output of a BEAST analyses run using the `BEAST.sh` best practices script.
